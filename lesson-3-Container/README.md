## Lesson 3 - Containers
The exercises in this lesson are an extension of the exercises you have already done in the previous lessons - **"Best Practices for Micro-Services Development"** and **"Independent Development"**.  We will use the same "Udagram" project, and convert the monolithic architecture into microservices running in separate containers. 

### Clone the project GitHub repository
Create a project folder in your local computer and clone the following Git repository - https://github.com/udacity/nd990-c3-microservices-v1

### Exercise
Go to the directory `/lesson-3-Container/exercises/`, where you would find the following sub-folders for each component of the project, as follows:
1. udacity-c3-frontend - For Ionic client web application, which consumes the RestAPI Backend
2. udacity-c3-restapi-feed - For "feed" microservice
3. udacity-c3-restapi-user - For "user" microservice
4. udacity-c3-deployment/docker - For running the Nginx as a reverse-proxy server
It will be helpful if you download and install the [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow the instructions as available in the classroom.
